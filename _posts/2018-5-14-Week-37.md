    <td>I encountered many issues this week, however, by using logic and the hints that Codecademy gives you, I managed to get through.

I had to use the the solutions after trying many times twice, but I was always close to the correct solution, but made it more complicated than it needed to be.

    <td>I was limited by my understanding of some components of the code. As I had not used the site in a week, I had forgotten many of the uses of variables and syntax.

I was also limited by  the people around me mostly. One of them, I helped once, and then whenever they had any problems they would call on me to solve them, even if they were really simple. This limited not only my learning, but also theirs. I need to work on not giving in and helping people as much in this situation.</td>
