  <tr>
    <td>I learned by following the instructions given to me, and from that, if I did not know what to do, I tried to work it out. As Python is a very logical language, this often worked well</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I was limited by  the people around me mostly. One of them, I helped once, and then whenever they had any problems they would call on me to solve them, even if they were really simple. This limited not only my learning, but also theirs. I need to work on not giving in and helping people as much in this situation.</td>

    <td>I will try to be less distracted by the people around me and instead focus on my own work. I will also try to work faster and more efficiently </td>
